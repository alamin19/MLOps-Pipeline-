MLOps Pipeline for AI-Driven Healthcare Analytics

Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for a healthcare AI model. The pipeline automates the process of data ingestion, model training, deployment, monitoring, and drift detection to ensure reliable and scalable machine learning operations.

Features

Data Ingestion: Loads healthcare patient data.

Model Training: Trains a Random Forest classifier for risk prediction.

Model Deployment: Uploads the trained model to AWS S3.

Model Monitoring: Detects drift in real-time and retrains if necessary.

MLOps Best Practices: Uses MLflow for model tracking and versioning.

Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install pandas numpy sklearn joblib boto3 mlflow

Running the Pipeline

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlops-healthcare.git
cd mlops-healthcare

Prepare the dataset (healthcare_patient_data.csv) and place it in the project directory.

Run the pipeline:

python mlops_pipeline.py

MLOps Workflow

Data Preparation: Loads and preprocesses patient health data.

Model Training: Uses RandomForestClassifier for risk prediction.

Model Deployment: Uploads the trained model to AWS S3 for scalability.

Monitoring & Drift Detection: Detects drift in patient data and triggers retraining if needed.

Deployment

This pipeline supports deployment on:

AWS SageMaker (for scalable model hosting)

Docker & Kubernetes (for cloud-native deployments)

CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions for automation)
